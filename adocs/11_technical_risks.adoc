=== Problems Detailed

==== Solid
Solid is a whole *new* world for us and it took us a while to adapt its specifications
and functionality to our project.

==== JavaScript and Node.JS
Although we used JavaScript many times in the past but it was very difficult
adapting to this language and managing node libraries as well as what dependencies
and versions to choose.

==== Libraries
There aren't much libraries to manage **Linked Data** and **RDF** resources and **SPARQL** and it was
difficult to find them and use them but with time we got used to it.

==== BDD
We have never used *Cucumber* and we are new to the *Behavior-Driven Development* world,
so it took us a few days to learn how to use it with **_Node_** and adapting it to Travis to build our app.

==== Deployment
We were gonna use *Docker* to deploy our app, but ,at the end, we decided to use *gh-pages* for simplicity.
