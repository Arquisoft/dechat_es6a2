=== Concepts Detailed


==== User Experience concepts (UX)
The user interface is for the moment only available in English and it's inspired
and that's because we want to the user to feel at ease and use a familiar UI instead of complicating it.

==== Safety and security concepts
The main objective of this whole app and Solid Specs is to ensure the security of
the user by choosing the person who he'd like to speak and not having to worry
about his data stolen because as we know, the messages and data shared is stored
in his private pod and no one will see it except him.

==== Architecture and design patterns
The application is in **main.js** and it is managed by the **ChatController.js** which uses additional libraries and services included in the **lib/** folder.

==== "Under-the-hood" Concepts
* Persistency :
****
the Data shared between the users is stored in each user's personal solid pod.
****

* Transaction handling :
****
In our app we ensure the correct use of ACID properties by sending and receiving the correcting messages without any changes in real time and concurrently.
****

* Exception and error handling :
****
The main _error_ not controlled by the app is having a **not stable** internet connection as it **could** damage the app's correct functioning.
****

* Reporting :
****
For reports, we use travis and code coverage to make sure everything is okay and also track all the changes made.
****

==== Development concepts
* Build
****
To build the app we use Node Js *webpack* running the following command
----
npm run build:web
----
****

* Test
****
It is very important to test our application in order to ensure the correct use of it and that's why we use various frameworks including **mocha** and **cucumber.js**.
****

* Deploy
****
We will be using **link:https://www.docker.com:[Docker]** to deploy our app in the future.
