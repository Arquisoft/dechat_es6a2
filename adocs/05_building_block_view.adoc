== Building Block View

This section consists of a decomposition of our system into building blocks, showcasing their inner dependencies.

=== Level 1

We begin the decomposition by displaying a white box description of the overall system -manifested in section III, Context Diagrams as 'DeChat' black box-.

It can be swiftly perceived that we have chosen a Model-View-Controller pattern for overall system architecture, reasoning being:

* It is a fairly suitable and easy-to-grasp architecture for web applications such as ours.
* We have created a few applications before using this approach.

|Name |Overview

|Service
|Performs an operation ordered by the Controller or another Service, working with user-provided data to persist or select information through Repository. Creates, joins and opens a chat, as well as storing and loading messages, either written by the user or received at his POD's inbox.

|Repository
|Either persists the data provided by a Service -inserts or updates data in current user's private POD folder as well as interlocutors' inbox- or selects stored/received data from current user's POD.
