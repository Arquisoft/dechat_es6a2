== Solution Strategy


=== Introduction
In this document, you will find the software decisions and solutions in order to ensure a **quality app** such as the technologies used and what is used for testing.

=== Decisions
The project is developed using the following :

.Technologies used for developing
|===
|Technology |Purpose

|Solid
|Following the solid specs, we'll ensure the data is stored in a **private** part of the user's pod.

|JavaScript
|As the purpose of our app is to be used on the web, JS is the obvious and best choice for web client applications.

|HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
|To ensure only the best **UI** and **UX**.

|Node JS
|For **server-side**. As we will use **npm** to manage dependencies and it's pretty good to create real-time apps.

.Technologies used for testing
[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|Technology |Purpose

|Mocha JS
|Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on **Node.JS** that are we using and in the browser

|istanbul nyc
|We'll be using these frameworks to run **Mocha** tests and to **supply** the integration platforms the information needed.

|cucumber-selenium
|To ensure Behaviour-Driven Development, we'll be using **link:https://cucumber.io[cucumber]** and **link:https://www.seleniumhq.org[Selenium]** which are JavaScript browser automation frameworks.

|Gatling
|To measure the performance of our web application.

.Continuous Integration Platforms
[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|Technology |Purpose

|Travis
|Our goal is to build healthier software by developing and testing. And as a _CI_ platform, Travis supports the development process by automatically **building and testing** code changes, providing us immediate feedback on the success of the change made.

|Coveralls
|In order to ensure a better **code coverage** by the tests made and remove unused code.

|Code Quality
|We use this _CI_ in order to be better developers and write *quality code* and make it understandable and and why not be reviewed and change by GitHub community
|===

.Managing RDF Data
[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|Dependency |Purpose

|n3
|It is an implementation of the RDF.js low-level specification that lets us handle RDF in JavaScript easily including storing or reading information.

|uniqid
|We use this as it will always create *unique id*  based on the current time, process and machine name.

|winston
|For logging and debugging purposes.

|uri
|URI.js is a scheme extendable URI parsing/validating/resolving for JS.

|Q
|To return promises read from the pods. A promise is an object that represents the return value or the thrown exception that the function may eventually provide.

|Comunica SPARQL RDFJS Init Actor
|We use for queries RDFJS queries.

=== Solution Aproaches
We started developing in javascript and node because we were inspired mostly by the great solid-chess application developed by  **link:https://github.com/pheyvaer[Pieter Heyvaert]**.
