==== Front End
to design the UI and offer the best UX possible, we are using _**HTML**_ and _**CSS**_
and _**Bootstrap**_ in addition to _jQuery_.

==== Back End
Moving to the functionality part, we are using basically *_JavaScript_* and *_Node.JS_*
to manage dependencies and libraries such as *n3* and *Q* to work with _RDF_ and _Linked Data_.

For the testing part, we are using *mocha* and *nyc* for unit tests,
and *cucumber-selenium* for **link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development:[BDD]** tests.

==== Persistence and Data Storage
Following *Solid* specifications, all the data shared between users are *private* and stored in their respective POD.

==== Continuous Integration
we are using **link:https://travis-ci.org/Arquisoft/dechat_es6a2:[Travis]**
for running the tests and checking the correct build of our app,
**link:https://coveralls.io/github/Arquisoft/dechat_es6a2?branch=master:[Coveralls]**
for code coverage to make sure of not forgetting any part of app
and **link:https://app.codacy.com/project/jelabra/dechat_es6a2/dashboard:[Code Quality]** .
