== Solution Strategy


=== Introduction
In this document, you will find the software decisions and solutions in order to ensure a **quality app** such as the technologies used and what is used for testing.

=== Decisions
The project is developed using the following :


* *Node.js*:

****
.Technologies used for developing
|===
|Technology |Purpose

|Solid
|Following the solid specs, we'll ensure the data is stored in a **private** part of the user's pod.

|JavaScript
|As the purpose of our app is to be used on the web, JS is the obvious and best choice for web client applications.

|HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
|To ensure only the best **UI** and **UX**.

|Node JS
|For **server-side**. As we will use **npm** to manage dependencies and it's pretty good to create real-time apps.

|===

.Organizational Constraints
|===
|Constraint |Explanation

|Software Development
|The project is available in this **GitHub** repository in order to use __Multiple Integration__ options such as **link:https://travis-ci.org/Arquisoft/dechat_es6a2[Travis]** and **link:https://coveralls.io/github/Arquisoft/dechat_es6a2[Code Coverage]** options and to simplify the code sharing and reviewing.

|Time
|There is limited time to complete the project and the documentation being **30th April 2019** the limit.

|===

.Conventions
|===
|Constraint |Explanation

|Arc42
|As a template for the documentation of the project, we must use link:http://arc42.org[Arc 42] format.

=== Solution Aproaches

Once we started to do the project of the chat, we took some direct solutions. We started to programming
in Javascript based in the project of a Solid Chess.  We will implement some integration test with Travis to take advantage of
the continuous integration service using Mocha and his assertion library to help us to prove and improve the code. We can connect to the pod and
we can send messages with Javascript using JQuery.
